/*
  # Fix RLS policies to prevent infinite recursion

  1. Changes
    - Remove role-based RLS policies that were causing infinite recursion
    - Simplify RLS to basic authentication checks
    - Move role-based access control to application level

  2. Security
    - Maintain basic RLS for authentication
    - Rely on application-level role checks for authorization
